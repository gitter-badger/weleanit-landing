                    We are developpers, community or marketing managers, students. We are all entrepreneurs. We care products, we love projects, we are found of technology. <br />
                    So, what about having a funny week-end to create new products? Meeting new people? Engaging new challenges? Discovering new technologies?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup">lean startup methodology</a>, we imagine new products. We lean them by keeping the main features to test they work, and create them in 2 days. Short? No. Enough to focus on the essentials.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Those products have nothing to do with our daily work: we want to experiment. Everyday-life projects, funny ones, sometimes stupid. Whatever they are, we do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once done, the products are shared with everybody: most of the time, we provide a demo website, and we always release the source code under an open source licence.
